Hi! I'm Komal Wavhal
A Technology Enthusiast. I ♥ to Code & Make cool stuff.
A Software Developer Who loves to learn and try new tools & technologies passionately

💼 About Me
I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast and Automation Specialist with over 7 years of experience delivering impactful AI/ML and RPA solutions across finance, healthcare, and consulting sectors. My journey has taken me from developing predictive models and intelligent automation for Fortune 500 clients to building real-time AI systems that address public safety, mental health, and financial decision-making.

🎓 Currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology (GPA: 4.0), I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Data Mining.
In addition to serving as a Recitation Leader at Stevens Institute of Technology, I’m also a Research Assistant working on the application of machine learning techniques to classify high-dimensional spectral data for bone research. My role involves method and protocol development and exploring tools such as Solo + MIA (Eigenvector) to support biomedical discovery. This research is grounded in the latest work on bone tissue water content and stiffness.

⚙️ Core Strengths:
•	Machine Learning | Deep Learning | NLP | Predictive Analytics
•	Automation (UiPath, Python, Selenium) | Statistical Modeling
•	Data Visualization (Tableau, Power BI) | Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP)
•	Full-stack ML/AI system development and model deployment

🏆 Recognized with multiple awards, including the JPMorgan Innovation Award, Corporate Excellence Award, and Impact Award, I’ve consistently led high-impact projects - such as automating compliance pipelines, forecasting financial sentiment with NLP, and building a real-time AI-powered crime prediction platform.

📚 I hold 40+ certifications from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Tableau, and more - constantly upskilling in LLMs, generative AI, and cloud-based AI solutions.

🔍 Looking for opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer, AI Researcher, or Data Scientist to design, develop, and deploy intelligent systems that drive innovation and deliver value.

🌍 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring novels, travelogues, and cultural narratives-fueling both my creativity and empathy in building user-centric AI.
